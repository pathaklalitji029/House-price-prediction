🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

1. A  Machine Learning project that predicts house prices based on area using Linear Regression in Python.
This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a regression problem — from data loading and visualization to model training and evaluation.

2. Dataset source Kaggle :-
Feature used Area and price

3. Technologies & Tools:-
Python
NumPy – numerical computations
Pandas – data manipulation
Matplotlib – data visualization
Scikit-learn – machine learning model

4. Workflow :-

A. Import required libraries
B. Load the dataset using Pandas
C. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
D. Visualize the relationship between area and price
E. Split data into training and testing sets
F. Train a Linear Regression model
G. Evaluate model performance
H. Make predictions on new data

5. Result after perform regression model  to make prediction 
The Linear Regression model successfully captures the relationship between house area and price.
The model performs well on unseen test data.
This project serves as a strong foundation for understanding regression problems in machine learning.
